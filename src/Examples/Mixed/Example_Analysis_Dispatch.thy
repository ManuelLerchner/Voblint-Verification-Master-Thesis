text \<open>
  \<open>analyse_sign_report\<close> (\<^theory>\<open>Voblint_Examples.Example_Sign_Codegen\<close>) and
  \<open>interval_check_report\<close>/\<open>analyse_interval_report\<close>
  (\<^theory>\<open>Voblint_Analysis.Interval_Checks\<close>) already share one observable
  result type, \<open>check_report_entry list\<close>
  (\<^theory>\<open>Voblint_Core.Abstract_Checks\<close>), even though the two domains'
  internal abstract states (\<open>sign abs_state\<close> vs \<open>ivl abs_state\<close>) genuinely
  differ. \<open>analyse\<close> below is therefore a thin dispatcher, not a new proof:
  each branch reuses the domain's own already-generic, already-sound report
  function unchanged.

  Interval's warrowing variant (\<open>analyse_interval_td\<close>) is deliberately not a
  branch here: it has no soundness theorem yet (see
  \<^theory>\<open>Voblint_Analysis.Interval_Exec_Sound\<close>), so it stays outside this
  verified frontend rather than silently reporting an unbacked
  \<open>Check_Proved\<close>/\<open>Check_Refuted\<close>.

  \<open>y := 1\<close> then check \<open>0 < y\<close> (should hold), then \<open>y := 0 - 1\<close> and check
  \<open>0 < y\<close> again (should now fail): a case where Interval's numeric bounds
  settle both checks precisely, while Sign's native D/G pipeline reports
  \<open>Check_Unknown\<close> for both --- the same always-join imprecision
  \<open>dgEx_inspect\<close> (\<^theory>\<open>Voblint_Examples.Exec_Sign_DG_Run\<close>) already
  documents for that pipeline, not a new limitation introduced here.

text \<open>
  The unified dispatcher exports the same way its two branches already do:
  \<open>analyse\<close> genuinely takes the domain choice and the program as runtime
  arguments, not constants baked in at export time.

  The AST constructors and \<open>imp_prog.make\<close> are exported alongside it so
  external Haskell/OCaml code can build a fresh \<open>imp_prog\<close> and hand it to
  \<open>analyse\<close>, rather than only being able to call \<open>analyse\<close> on values built
  inside Isabelle --- this is what the regression drivers under
  \<open>codegen/regression\<close> use.

  \<^theory>\<open>HOL-Library.Code_Target_Numeral\<close> makes \<open>int\<close>/\<open>nat\<close> abstract types
  backed by the target language's native arbitrary-precision integer
  (Haskell's \<open>Integer\<close>, OCaml's target-numeral representation) instead of
  Isabelle's own binary-numeral/Peano-successor encodings, so arithmetic and
  comparisons inside the exported analyser run on native integers rather
  than walking a \<open>Num\<close>/\<open>Nat\<close> term. \<open>int_of_integer\<close>/\<open>nat_of_integer\<close> and
  their inverses \<open>integer_of_int\<close>/\<open>integer_of_nat\<close> are the resulting
  bridge --- the only way external code can build or inspect an \<open>int\<close>/\<open>nat\<close>
  once the representation is opaque.

  \<^theory>\<open>HOL-Library.Code_Abstract_Char\<close> does the same for \<open>char\<close> ---
  relevant because \<^typ>\<open>vname\<close> is \<^typ>\<open>char list\<close>, so every variable
  name and every CFG/map lookup keyed on one compares characters. Locals,
  globals, and procedure names all resolve to native-integer character
  comparisons instead of an 8-bit-vector term walk. \<open>char_of_integer\<close> and
  \<open>integer_of_char\<close> are the resulting bridge.
